## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Grace. I am a 3rd-year undergrad reading Maths & Stats at Oxford. I have wide-ranging interests spanning ethics, game theory, data science, artificial intelligence, and finance, and am especially passionate about exploring the intersection of social/behavioural sciences and quantitative analysis!

My pronouns are she/they. I'm not on GitHub that much. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ygraceyu/) or via [email](mailto:yongqing.grace.yu@gmail.com).
