## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Grace. I am a 3rd-year undergrad reading Maths & Stats at Oxford. I have wide-ranging interests -- spanning ethics, game theory, data science, artificial intelligence, and finance -- and am especially passionate about exploring the intersection of social and behavioural sciences with quantitative analysis!!

My pronouns are she/they. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ygraceyu/) or [email](mailto:yongqing.grace.yu@gmail.com).
